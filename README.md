# ALU
This code implements a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit in VHDL. The ALU performs operations on two 4-bit input vectors (a and b) based on a 2-bit control signal (Ctr). The Ctr signal determines the operation: addition (00), bitwise shift left (01), subtraction (10), or bitwise AND (11). The result of the operation is output on the 4-bit Result vector, and an overflow (OVF) signal is generated by capturing the 5th bit of the internal result (res_temp), which is a 5-bit signed variable used for intermediate calculations. The design uses a process block to compute the result based on the Ctr signal, ensuring that the ALU performs the correct operation and updates the outputs accordingly.
